            <span class="bio__span">Effemar</span> is the Swiss-bred duo formed of <span class="bio__span">Doane Allan</span> and <span class="bio__span">Julien Grosjean</span> emerged on the scene in late 2020. Their first single
‘Deep Sea’ released on the German label <span class="bio__span">Selected</span> got its first 3 million streams within a month after release. Their next
two singles ‘Saturday Night’ and ‘Needing Space’ repeated the fate of their predecessor and got several million streams
in no time.
          </p>
          <p class="bio__paragraph">
            <span class="bio__span">Effemar</span> have been performing live at venues around Lausanne and other picturesque spots of their homeland, keeping their concerts
discrete and intimate. In 2022 the duo hit another milestone in their story by releasing their single 'Ocean' on San Holo's
independent label <span class="bio__span">bitbird</span>. This immersed the project into an active artist-friendly community and only consolidated
Effemar's position in the scene.
          </p>
          <p class="bio__paragraph">
            <span class="bio__span">Since</span> then Effemar has been going deeper in their own world, affirming who they are as artists with their own vocals and
            a very unique sound. With nostalgic melodies, dancy drums, and uplifting synth lines, the duo appeals to deep house fans
            as well as indie and pop audiences. They aim to act as a bridge linking the underground and popular music without losing
            their strong identity.
